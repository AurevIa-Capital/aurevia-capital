# RMSE Migration Summary

## Overview
Updated the entire ML training pipeline to use **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)** instead of MAE (Mean Absolute Error) as the primary performance metric for model selection and evaluation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Training Pipeline (`src/ml/training/trainer.py`)
- **Line 360**: Changed `get_best_model()` default metric from `'mae'` to `'rmse'`
- **Effect**: Best model selection for each watch now uses RMSE as the primary criterion

### 2. Training Runner (`src/ml/run_training.py`)
- **Line 304**: Updated best model selection call to use `metric="rmse"` 
- **Line 306-310**: Modified best model summary to include both RMSE and MAE metrics
- **Line 378**: Updated logging to display both RMSE and MAE for best models
- **Effect**: Training summary now shows RMSE as primary metric with MAE as secondary

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning (`src/ml/training/tuner.py`)
- **Line 113**: Changed `grid_search()` default scoring from `'mae'` to `'rmse'`
- **Line 235**: Changed `random_search()` default scoring from `'mae'` to `'rmse'`
- **Line 518**: Changed `tune_model()` default scoring from `'mae'` to `'rmse'`
- **Line 593**: Changed `tune_multiple_models()` default scoring from `'mae'` to `'rmse'`
- **Effect**: All hyperparameter optimization now uses RMSE as the default evaluation metric

### 4. Multi-Horizon Visualizer (`src/ml/multi_horizon_visualizer.py`)
- **Updated performance analysis plots** to use RMSE as primary metric
- **Fallback logic**: If RMSE not available (older training results), falls back to MAE
- **Effect**: New visualizations prioritize RMSE in performance comparisons

### 5. Documentation (`CLAUDE.md`)
- **Updated ML Models section** to document RMSE as primary performance metric
- **Added explanation** of why RMSE provides better sensitivity to larger prediction errors
- **Effect**: Clear documentation of the new evaluation strategy

## Why RMSE vs MAE?

### RMSE Benefits:
- **Penalizes larger errors more heavily** - Better for financial forecasting where large mistakes are costly
- **More sensitive to outliers** - Important for watch price prediction where extreme values matter
- **Standard in regression evaluation** - Widely accepted metric in ML communities
- **Mathematical properties** - Differentiable everywhere, better for optimization

### Impact on Model Selection:
- Models that perform consistently (low variance) are now preferred over those with occasional large errors
- Better alignment with business objectives where large price prediction errors are particularly costly
- More robust model selection for luxury watch market volatility

## Training Output Changes

### Before (MAE-based):
```
Best models by asset:
  Audemars_Piguet-Steeloyal_Oak_Offshore-22378: linear (MAE: 10.6)
```

### After (RMSE-based):
```
Best models by asset:
  Audemars_Piguet-Steeloyal_Oak_Offshore-22378: linear (RMSE: 12.4, MAE: 10.6)
```

## Training Summary Structure

### Updated JSON Output:
```json
{
  "best_models_by_asset": {
    "watch_name": {
      "model_name": "linear",
      "rmse": 12.4,      // PRIMARY metric
      "mae": 10.6,       // Secondary metric
      "training_time": 0.036
    }
  }
}
```

## Backward Compatibility

- **Existing training results** remain valid
- **Visualization fallback**: If RMSE not available, uses MAE
- **All metrics still calculated**: Both RMSE and MAE are computed and stored
- **No breaking changes**: Existing APIs and interfaces unchanged

## Verification

### Test Results:
✅ **Model Selection Test**: Confirmed that `get_best_model()` correctly selects model with lowest RMSE
✅ **Training Pipeline Test**: Verified RMSE is used as default metric throughout training
✅ **Visualization Update**: New charts prioritize RMSE in performance analysis

### Next Training Run:
```bash
# Environment setup
source activate timepiece

# Re-train models with RMSE-based selection
python -m src.ml.multi_horizon_training --horizons 7 14 30

# Generate updated visualizations 
python -m src.ml.multi_horizon_visualizer --summary-only
```
